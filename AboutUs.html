            <p>Amazon has come a long way since it was founded by Jeff Bezos in his garage in Bellevue, Wash., on July 5, 1994.

            The following is a brief history and timeline of events that have evolved 
            Amazon from its humble beginnings to a multinational business empire.</p><br>
            <h3>
                The 1990s
            </h3>
            <p>
                Amazon officially opened for business as an online bookseller on July 16, 1995. Originally, Bezos had incorporated the company as Cadabra but later changed the name to Amazon. Bezos is said to have browsed a dictionary for a word beginning with A for the value of alphabetic placement. He selected the name Amazon because it was exotic and different and as a reference to his plan for the company's size to reflect that of the Amazon River, one of the largest rivers in the world.
                Since its inception, the company's motto has always been "get big fast."
