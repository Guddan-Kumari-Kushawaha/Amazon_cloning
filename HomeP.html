                    <p>Amazon (Amazon.com) is the world's largest online retailer and a prominent cloud service provider.</p>
                    <p><br>Originally started as an online bookselling company, Amazon has morphed into an internet-based business enterprise that is largely focused on providing e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming and artificial intelligence (AI) services.
                    <br>Following an Amazon-to-buyer sales approach, the company offers a monumental product range and inventory, enabling consumers to buy just about anything, including clothing, beauty supplies, gourmet food, jewelry, books, movies, electronics, 
                    pet supplies, furniture, toys, garden supplies and household goods.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The ever-changing landscape has somewhat dictated the success of most online retailing businesses in the industry.
                    However, it has proven to have thrived and preserved with constant progress and growth despite all the odds for Amazon's part. 
                    Amazon was launched in 1994, and since then, it has maintained at the helm of its business operations, enticing a vast client base
                    worldwide. This is partly because of Amazon's strategic and well-defined mission and vision statements, and core values.
                    The management is generally keen on keeping everyone in line with the provisions of the company's principles.</p><br>

                    <p>For any company staying on top and relevant with the changing times is already a challenge. Amazon has successfully sustained its leadership in the industry and keeps staying on top of its competition. 
                        It's partially thanks to a compelling mission, vision, and core values components.</p>
                    <p><br>Though these principles are not exclusive for Amazon only, other companies, like startups, can take inspiration from the firm in formulating their brand's principles. 
                        It is also evident that the principles were classified using a mind map. It's the same for you. You can use a mind mapping tool to structure the mission, vision, and core values.
                        EdrawMind is a straightforward software where users can easily navigate through the interface.
                        You can use the pre-built Mission and Vision Statement Analysis Template if you want to jump from the hassle of creating your skeleton.</p>
                        <p><br>Headquartered in Seattle, Amazon has individual websites, software development centers, 
                            customer service centers, data centers and fulfillment centers around the world.</p>
